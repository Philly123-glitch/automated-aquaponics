# automatedAquaponics
This repo holds the entirety of code used by an automated aquaponics system primarily involving a linux computer and arduino connected via a serial port.
I've also added safety and design considerations in the folder "Physical Design".  And some pictures of the results in "Pictures".

report.sh will need to be scheduled through a cronjob.  Refer to designConsiderations.txt for specific instructions.
